# 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (WAF) – Custom Rule-Based Attack Detection for Non-Technical Users


---

## 📘 **Project Overview**
This project implements a lightweight but powerful **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** designed to allow **non-technical users** to create and manage custom security rules through a simple dashboard.  
It analyzes incoming HTTP requests in real time, detects malicious payloads (SQL Injection, XSS, LFI, RCE, etc.), blocks them dynamically, and provides a comprehensive **real-time analytics dashboard** with alerts, logs, statistics, and attack summaries.

This WAF serves as a secure middleware layer protecting any Flask-based web application.

---

## ❗ **Problem Statement**
Most existing WAF solutions require deep technical expertise, complex configuration, and command-line knowledge.  
Small businesses, students, and non-technical administrators cannot easily configure or maintain such systems.

There is a need for a **simple, visually intuitive, non-technical-friendly** WAF that:

- Allows users to create rules without writing code  
- Automatically detects attacks using real-world signatures  
- Provides clear dashboards and alerts  
- Logs all suspicious activity  
- Works out-of-the-box with minimal setup  

This project solves exactly that.

## 🔍 **Novelty of the Project**
What makes this WAF different?

### 🌟 **1. Built Specifically for Non-Technical Users**
Most WAFs are technical and require expertise.  
Our system allows **anyone**, even without programming knowledge, to create rules using:

✔ Plain keywords  
✔ Simple regex  
✔ UI-based rule builder  
✔ Toggle-based configuration  

### 🌟 **2. Real-Time Detection + Real-Time Alerts**
Unlike simple logging WAFs, this project includes:

- Real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Live alert cards on dashboard
- Optional alert sound
- Repeated-attack correlation engine

### 🌟 **3. Built-in Attack Pattern Library**
Automatically detects:
- SQLi  
- XSS  
- LFI/RFI  
- RCE  
- Directory traversal  
- Command injection  

### 🌟 **4. Simulation Engine**
The `/simulate_attack` endpoint generates real attack payloads for testing the system instantly.

### 🌟 **5. Extensible, Modular, and Lightweight**
Designed to be plug-and-play with any Flask project.
